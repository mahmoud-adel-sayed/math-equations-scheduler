# VA Computing Task
This is a sample app that communicates with a math engine service to perform some arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between two operands). The math engine service is a background service and is responsible for executing the math equations entered by the user as scheduled tasks and notifying the app about the results.

### Important Implementation Details
1. The default implementation code is written in **Java** and there is another implementation written in **Kotlin**.
2. The background service relies on the **WorkManager** for scheduling tasks.
3. Delay duration won't be exact if the device enters *Doze Mode*, WorkManager will batch jobs during maintenance windows to optimize battery usage, if we want the tasks to be executed at exact time, we can use **Alarm Manager API** and call setExactAndAllowWhileIdle() but this practice is discouraged, as it is not good for battery performance.
4. The background service will be restarted after being destroyed by the OS or after device boot.
5. App relies on [Fused Location Provider API][FusedLocationProvider] to get location information with **High Accuracy** and **10 seconds Frequency**, that may cause significant battery drain but we could increase the Frequency and lower the accuracy to minimize the battery usage.
6. The project is **simply structured** but in a real project we should consider using some well known archetectures like (_MVVM_ or _MVP_).
7. The app UI is simple and represented by single *Activity*, but could be splitted it into multiple *Fragments*.
8. Unit & Instrumentation Tests code is written in **Kotlin** and tests java implementation.
9. The project is **tested only on Android Version 7.0**, but has built to support Android 8.0 or higher.

### Analysis and Profiling
* Battery profiling data files are located in `profiling/battery` directory, these files are generated by the Batterystats Tool and we can visualize/analyze them using [Battery Historian][BatteryHistorian].
* The captured heap dump file is located in `profiling/memory` directory, we can import the HPROF (.hprof) file into the Memory Profiler.

### Build & Installation Instructions
There are two gradle custom tasks that could be used to clean, build, and install the app, one for the QA flavor and the other for the Prod flavor
* On Windows, run the following commands in a terminal window:
	use `gradlew cleanBuildInstallQA` to install the QA version of the app.
	use `gradlew cleanBuildInstallProd` to install the Prod version of the app.
* On Linux or Mac, run the following commands in a terminal window:
	use `./gradlew cleanBuildInstallQA` to install the QA version of the app.
	use `./gradlew cleanBuildInstallProd` to install the Prod version of the app.

### Other Notes
* The project could be implemented using some Jetpack libraries like (Data Binding, ViewModel, LiveData, etc..).
* We could use a dependency injection framework like *Dagger*.
